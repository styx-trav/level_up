goal : decentralized shapes to make up a whole level

	:: not all displayed at once, moving with the character's arrows;
		//then settles where finished
	:: climbables ?
	:: based on a text file, into char **map
		:: spaces being nothing
		:: F being flowers, T being trees, C being clouds, D being doors
	:: occasional interactive object (here doors)


goal : a usable player icon

	:: possible jump moves ?
	:: walking/climbing/touching animations ?
	:: a structure where current spot of player is stored
		//for display
		//for interaction
	:: a smaller put_img_to_window for player movement in the bottom left corner
		//for speed of display


goal : more depth

	:: multiple text files per environment, where images overlap and converge en quinconces
		//for forests
		//for grass-type environments
	:: colors that gray out with the overlap

goal : small animation of a leaf in the wind

	:: leaf going left, leaf going right, leaf straight
		//three levels on each side
	:: establish tempo
	:: structure retains the side to move to next
	:: loop through the seven different images stored in structure as well
